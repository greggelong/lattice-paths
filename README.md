a visualization of Project Euler 15 lattice paths in p5js


Here is a visualization of Project Euler 15. They ask you to calculate how many paths through a grid. It is a very compelling  question with a few interesting ways to solve it. There are a few ways to find the answer but by far the most visually engaging one is by permutation of possible shortest paths. Meaning any move that does not back track. Here I am visualizing the moving to the right and down in a 10 by 10 grid.  I am choosing paths randomly from an array of permutations of the paths from 0,0 to 9,9.
